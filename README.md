# Gecco-Curve

This code provides functionalities to produce the first three iterations of the Gecco curve coordinates. It uses the coordinates of a circles to build and output the coordinates of the gecco curves. To our knowledge this has not been done previously. The aim of the gecco curve shape is to use it to model a conic cavity for Professor Chao Lin Kuo.

The following third party libraries were used:
- math
- matplotlib
- numpy
- argparse
- unittest
